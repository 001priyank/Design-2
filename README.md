## Problem 1:
Design a Skip List.A skip list is a data structure for storing a sorted list of items using a hierarchy of linked lists that connect increasingly sparse subsequences of the items. These auxiliary lists allow item lookup with efficiency comparable to balanced binary search trees (that is, with number of probes proportional to log n instead of n). 

## Problem 2:(https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)
Design a HashSet without using any built-in hash table libraries.
To be specific, your design should include these functions:
add(value): Insert a value into the HashSet. 
contains(value) : Return whether the value exists in the HashSet or not.
remove(value): Remove a value in the HashSet. If the value does not exist in the HashSet, do nothing.
